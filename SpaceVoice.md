# SpaceVoice AI: World-Class Agency Specification

## 1. Project Identity & Goal
- **Name:** SpaceVoice AI
- **Primary Vertical:** Home Services (HVAC focus).
- **Core Mission:** Mirroring $100k+ agencies (MedVoice, Assort, SpiderX) to deliver enterprise-grade conversion and zero-latency triage.

## 2. The Solid Stack (Step-by-Step)
- **Voice Orchestration:** Retell AI (for 140ms response and proprietary barge-in logic).
- **The Brain (Logic):** Claude 4.5 Sonnet (for perfect tool-calling and vertical reasoning).
- **Telephony:** Telnyx (for private-backbone audio transport and sub-200ms latency).

## 3. Agency Mirroring (The 'World Class' Framework)
SpaceVoice will combine the winning strategies from 5 successful verticals:
- **Medical Pattern (Assort/MedVoice):** Implement 'Emergency Triage Logic'. Distinguish between routine and high-value urgent jobs (e.g., HVAC safety hazards vs. maintenance).
- **Real Estate Pattern (SpiderX):** Use 'VIP Intake' tone. Capture high-intent data (budget, urgency) to suggest 'curated solutions' during the call.
- **HVAC Pattern (JustCall/TechWize):** Instant 24/7 dispatcher logic. Direct injection of bookings into field management software (e.g., ServiceTitan).
- **IT Pattern (Intellectyx):** Scalable tool-calling for technical troubleshooting before dispatching a tech.

## 4. Competitive Advantage
- **Zero-Detection:** By pairing Telnyx with Retell, we eliminate the 3-second 'AI pause' that kills conversion.
- **Outcome-Based Reporting:** Post-call analysis must extract: (1) Urgent dispatch needs, (2) Potential job value, (3) Customer sentiment.
