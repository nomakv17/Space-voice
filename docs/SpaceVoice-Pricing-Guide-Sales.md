## Sales Talking Points

### For Cost-Conscious Buyers
> "At $99/month, SpaceVoice costs less than 2 hours of a receptionist's time. You get 24/7 coverage, never miss a call, and save over $30,000 annually."

### For Quality-Focused Buyers
> "Our Premium tier uses OpenAI's latest voice technology—the same AI powering ChatGPT. Your callers won't know they're talking to AI."

### For High-Volume Buyers
> "At scale, we're 40-70% cheaper than Retell and Vapi. Our Budget tier at $0.05/minute means a 5-minute call costs just 25 cents."

### For Enterprise Buyers
> "We include dedicated support, custom integrations, and hands-on onboarding. Our setup fee reflects real value—not a DIY platform."

---

## Objection Handling

### "Your setup fee is too high"
> "Our setup fee includes personalized agent configuration, integration support, and 30-90 days of dedicated support. Competitors charge $0 because they offer zero support—you're on your own. Our clients are up and running in days, not weeks."

### "Competitor X is cheaper per minute"
> "When you add up their hidden costs—separate STT, TTS, LLM, and telephony fees—they're actually 30-50% more expensive. Our pricing is all-inclusive."

### "We need HIPAA compliance"
> "We can add HIPAA compliance for $500/month—compared to Vapi's $1,000/month. Our total cost is still lower."

### "Can we get a discount?"
> Volume discounts available:
> - $500+/month: 10% off
> - $1,000+/month: 15% off
> - $3,000+/month: 25% off (Enterprise pricing)
